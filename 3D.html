            <h2>Comparing 3D Printing with Other Manufacturing</h2>
            <p>Additive manufacturing (e.g. welding, clay modelling, 3D printing) adds material, while subtractive manufacturing (e.g. CNC machining, laser cutting, electrical discharge machining) takes it away. Other types of manufacturing include forming, injection molding or casting, which are the conventional production methods. 3D printing is a form of <i>additive manufacturing</i> as it creates objects by adding layer upon layer of material until the shape of the object is formed. </p>
            <p>Like all additive and subtractive manufacturing, 3D printing is suitable for producing prototypes and small products that are expensive to produce using other manufacturing processes. Compared to the conventional manufacturing on a large-scale production, 3D printing is much slower and more expensive. </p>
            <h2>Pros and Cons of 3D Printing</h2>
            <h3>Strengths</h3>
            <p>There is a saying by the lecturers: if you can draw it, you can print it! Meaning to say if we are able to design anything in Fusion 360/ or other CAD software, we can print all of them. Using 3D printing is faster to produce prototype, which the designs are even customised using CAD. 3D printing can produce structures, such as complex or hollow interior sections, that are impossible to produce using non-additive processes. Most of the 3D prints are made up of up lots of hollow sections to save money, material and printing time, while still maintaining a certain structural integrity.</p>
            <p>As an additive manufacturing, 3D printing also generates less waste than subtractive processes, since no material is cut away or discarded (with the exception of build adhesion plates. The filaments that are used can be eco-friendly, like the PLA filaments that SP uses.</p>
            <h3>Weaknesses:</h3>
            <p>One of the major disadvantages of using 3D printing is the slow and tedious process, plus it will be very expensive for large-scale production. Another disadvantage is that 3D print parts do not have the strength, heat resistance (since the material has low melting point) and surface finish for final parts. Tiny pores in the wall surfaces are resulted from 3D printing, which allows easy contamination.</p>
            <p>There are also many constraints of 3D printing, which will be covered later on.</p>
            <h2>Principles of 3D Printing</h2>
            <p>FFF/FDM (Fused Filament Fabrication / Fused Deposition Modelling) is the most common method used in 3D printing. (Other methods include LCD 3D printing, Stereolithography Apparatus and  Selective laser sintering). It melts and deposits layers of materials on the print bed, then these layers fuse together in a pattern to create an object. The material is usually melted just past its glass transition temperature, and then extruded in a pattern next to or on top of previous extrusions, creating an object layer by layer.</p>
